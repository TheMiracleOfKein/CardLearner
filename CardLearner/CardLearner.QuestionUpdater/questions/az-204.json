All system properties must be prefixed with sys. in the conditional expression. The SQL-language subset for filter conditions tests for the existence of properties (EXISTS), as well as for null-values (IS NULL), logical NOT/AND/OR, relational operators, simple numeric arithmetic, and simple text pattern matching with LIKE.Correlation Filters - A CorrelationFilter holds a set of conditions that are matched against one or more of an arriving message\u0027s user and system properties. A common use is to match against the CorrelationId property, but the application can also choose to match against ContentType, Label, MessageId, ReplyTo,ReplyToSessionId, SessionId, To, and any user-defined properties. A match exists when an arriving message\u0027s value for a property is equal to the value specified in the correlation filter. For string expressions, the comparison is case-sensitive. When specifying multiple match properties, the filter combines them as a logicalAND condition, meaning for the filter to match, all conditions must match.Boolean filters - The TrueFilter and FalseFilter either cause all arriving messages (true) or none of the arriving messages (false) to be selected for the subscription.Reference:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/topic-filters",

This policy essentially uses the managed identity to obtain an access token from Azure Active Directory for accessing the specified resource. After successfully obtaining the token, the policy will set the value of the token in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.Incorrect Answers:A: Use the authentication-basic policy to authenticate with a backend service using Basic authentication. This policy effectively sets the HTTP Authorization header to the value corresponding to the credentials provided in the policy.B: Anonymous is no authentication at all.D: Your code needs credentials to authenticate to cloud services, but you want to limit the visibility of those credentials as much as possible. Ideally, they never appear on a developer\u0027s workstation or get checked-in to source control. Azure Key Vault can store credentials securely so they aren\u0027t in your code, but to retrieve them you need to authenticate to Azure Key Vault. To authenticate to Key Vault, you need a credential!

The company supports agricultural production resources by distributing seeds fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery to the farms.Current Environment -The company is migrating all applications from an on-premises datacenter to Microsoft Azure. Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff.Corporate website -\u2022\tThe company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources.Farms -\u2022\tThe company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications.Distributors -\u2022\tDistributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website -\u2022\tThe site must be migrated to Azure App Service.\u2022\tCosts must be minimized when hosting in Azure.\u2022\tApplications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources.\u2022\tAll code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production.\u2022\tFile transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase.\u2022\tAll site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit.\u2022\tA queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests.Farms -\u2022\tFarmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID.Distributors -\u2022\tThe company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs.\u2022\tAPI telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data.Internal staff -\u2022\tApp and API updates must be validated before release to production.\u2022\tStaff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update.\u2022\tStaff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID.Security -\u2022\tAll web communications must be secured by using TLS/HTTPS.\u2022\tWeb content must be restricted by country/region to support corporate compliance standards.\u2022\tThe principle of least privilege must be applied when providing any user rights or process access rights.\u2022\tManaged identities for Azure resources must be used to authenticate services that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication.Issues -Corporate website -\u2022\tFarmers report HTTP 503 errors at the same time as internal staff report that CPU and memory usage are high.\u2022\tDistributors report HTTP 502 errors at the same time as internal staff report that average response times and networking traffic are high.\u2022\tInternal staff report webpage load sizes are large and take a long time to load.\u2022\tDevelopers receive authentication errors to Service Bus when they debug locally.Distributors -\u2022\tMany API telemetry values are sent in a short period of time. Telemetry traffic, data costs, and storage costs must be reduced while preserving a statistically correct analysis of the data points sent by the APIs.You need to provide internal staff access to the production site after a validation.How should you complete the code segment?

However, in order to retrieve keys and secrets from Azure KeyVault, you need to authorize a user or application with Azure Key Vault, which in its turn needs another credential. Managed Service Identity avoids the need of storing credentials for Azure Key Vault in application or environment settings by creating a Service Principal for each application or cloud service on whichManaged Service Identity is enabled. This Service Principal enables you to call a local MSI endpoint to get an access token from Azure AD using the credentials of the Service Principal. This token is then used to authenticate to an Azure Service, for example Azure Key Vault.Box 2: Azure Key Vault -Azure Key Vault allows you to securely access sensitive information from within your applications:* Keys, secrets, and certificates are protected without your having to write the code yourself, and you can easily use them from your applications.Use Azure Key Vault to store only secrets for your application.

    "Explanation": "Box 1: ID -Scenario: Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.ID token - A JWT that contains claims that you can use to identify users in your application. This token is securely sent in HTTP requests for communication between two components of the same application or service. You can use the claims in an ID token as you see fit. They\u0027re commonly used to display account information or to make access control decisions in an application. ID tokens are signed, but the\u0027re not encrypted. When your application or API receives an ID token, it must validate the signature to prove that the token is authentic. Your application or API must also validate a few claims in the token to prove that it\u0027s valid.Depending on the scenario requirements, the claims validated by an application can vary, but your application must perform some common claim validations in every scenario.Box 2: Oid -Oid - The immutable identifier for the \u0022principal\u0022 of the request - the user or service principal whose identity has been verified. In ID tokens and app\u002Buser tokens, this is the object ID of the user. In app-only tokens, this is the object ID of the calling service principal. It can also be used to perform authorization checks safely and as a key in database tables. This ID uniquely identifies the principal across applications - two different applications signing in the same user will receive the same value in the oid claim.Incorrect:Aud - Identifies the intended recipient of the token. For Azure AD B2C, the audience is the application ID. Your application should validate this value and reject the token if it doesn\u0027t match. Audience is synonymous with resource.Idp - Records the identity provider that authenticated the subject of the token. This value is identical to the value of the Issuer claim unless the user account not in the same tenant as the issuer - guests, for instance. If the claim isn\u0027t present, it means that the value of iss can be used instead. For personal accounts being used in an organizational context (for instance, a personal account invited to an Azure AD tenant), the idp claim may be \u0027live.com\u0027 or an STS URI containing theMicrosoft account tenant.Reference:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens",

    "Explanation": "Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.B: A dedicated gateway is server-side compute that is a front-end to your Azure Cosmos DB account. When you connect to the dedicated gateway, it both routes requests and caches data.You can provision a dedicated gateway to improve performance at scale.You must connect to Azure Cosmos DB using the dedicated gateway in order to use the integrated cache. The dedicated gateway has a different endpoint from the standard one provided with your Azure Cosmos DB account. When you connect to your dedicated gateway endpoint, your application sends a request to the dedicated gateway, which then routes the request to different backend nodes. If possible, the integrated cache will serve the result.C: Azure Cache for Redis perfectly complements Azure database services such as Cosmos DB. It provides a cost-effective solution to scale read and write throughput of your data tier.
